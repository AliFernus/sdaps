Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.8
==================================

Important changes:
 * recognize: prevent division by zero error
 * recognize: try barcode detection both with and without kfill
 * recognize: ignore data from previous run
 * csv: Add support to specify delimiter
 * csv, ids: allow output to any file including stdout
 * gui: properly escape all strings

New and updated languages:
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.7
==================================

The most important change in this release is that the
import of image data has been simplified.

SDAPS can now do an image format conversion automatically
as part of the "add" command, removing the necessity of
using "convert" or some other external method to preprocess
the images. As before, this feature requires OpenCV.

Another change is that SDAPS now imports PDF files
directly. If a PDF file contains a full page image
(i.e. a scanned document) then this image is used
directly to prevent image quality loss due to resampling.
This feature requires poppler to be installed.

Overall these changes make it a lot easier to work with
different scanners. It is now only neccessary to
pass the "--convert" option to the "add" command to
add files that are not already in the expected format.

Important changes:
 * stamp: Fix re-stamping all IDs
 * add: Implement conversion feature (--convert option)
 * convert: Add support for reading PDF files

New and updated languages:
 * German
 * Portuguese (Brazil)


Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.6
==================================

This release adds support to use QR code instead of Code-128. The
main advantage is that QR-Code contains redundancy so that recognition
should be more reliable even with bad scans.
Another important change is that it is now possible to select different
modes for checkbox detection without modifying the source code. This
should simplify the usage of SDAPS in certain cases.

Feedback for optimizing the different modes is of course welcome. The
thresholds have not been tested extensively.

Important changes:
 * Support for QR-Code based IDs has been added ("qr" style)
 * csv export: Allow export of freeform textboxes as images
 * Updated example and testcase for newer multicol versions
 * tex: Fix writing sdaps file for all macros.
 * Allow selection of different checkbox detection modes.

New and updated languages:
 * Portoguese (copy of Portoguese (Brazil))
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.5
==================================

Important changes:
 * report: Fix import of PIL (Florian Rinke)
 * odt: Fix annotation on setup failure
 * gui: Fix memory leak
 * latex: Small improvements to class usability
 * translations: Fix LaTeX dictionary names.

New and updated languages:
 * Finnish
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.4
==================================

This is mostly a bugfix and translations release, as there was still some
fallout from the refactoring done in the last release. Thanks to everyone
who submitted patches to fix these!

Important changes:
 * dependency, build, and import fixes (#44, #46, and more)
 * fix layout changes in LaTeX and example (introduced in 1.1.2)
 * report: fix non A4 paper sizes (issue #41)

New and updated languages:
 * Portuguese (Brazil)
 * Spanish
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.3
==================================

With this release SDAPS has been restructured internally. There are two
reasons for doing this. The first is to improve the API which
simplifies the usage of it in custom scripts. Another point is that
the old code was incompatible with the import handling of python 3. So
doing this change is also a prerequisite for a future port to python 3.x.

Other changes include:
 * GUI: Fix an offset error with new GTK+ versions
 * GUI: Improved keyboard navigation (issue #30)
 * GUI: Improved mouse handling and overlay drawing
 * GUI: Show the questionnaire ID on the right side
 * GUI: Sort images by page number
 * LaTeX: Improved unicode support
 * LaTeX: Fixed precision issues in report generation
 * LaTeX: Fixed some whitespace issues in the LaTeX class
 * ODT: When stamping a single document, keep forms intact
 * reorder: Fix reordering of simplex documents
 * recognize: Slight changes in the OMR heuristics.
 * Fixed issues in the upgrade routine


New and updated translations:
 * German
 * Spanish

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.2
==================================

This release brings a lot of small improvements, but also some new features.
The main new feature is the addition of a "convert" module, which can be used
to convert non-monochrome scans into monochrome images for later processing.
This module is also able to apply 3D-transformations as they are neccessary
when the source image was done using a camera.
This new module requires OpenCV. Note that using a feed scanner is still
prefered to this method.

Other changes include:
 * LaTeX: Fix compilation of large documents (by suppressing position output)
 * LaTeX: Fix multicolumn items and cline at the start of choicequestions
 * ODT: Custom styling in answers and question is now possible.
 * Various improvements and fixes in the corner mark detection code
 * New "custom" style which can be used when customizing the behaviour of SDAPS
 * A PDF with annotations will now be created if there was an error during setup
 * An issue in the base dir search code that affected OSX has been fixed

New and updated translations:
 * Arabic

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.1
==================================

Important changes:
 * Fix the "min coverage" heuristic
 * Export text as UTF-8 in CSV files (issue #23)
 * report: Ignore empty sheets
 * Add "verified" and "recognized" flags for sheets. Recognition will
   not be done by default if either flag is set.
 * GUI: Pressing "Enter" now sets the "verified" flag
 * LaTeX class: Paint inner area of boxes white. This is required to allow
   background coloring.

And a couple more small bugfixes and additions.

New and updated translations:
 * German
 * Dutch

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.0
==================================

This release brings a lot of new goodies. As a development release it may
still be a bit rough in a few places, but everyone is invited to play with it
and report any issues :-)

Important changes:
 * Support for duplex scanning of simplex questionnaires (issue #1)
 * Freeform fields can be manually replaced with text (issue #14)
 * Mark questions can now have an arbitrary checkbox count (issue #7)
 * Correctly pick new questionnaire IDs during stamp (issue #22)
 * Report paper size is now locale dependend (issue #9)
 * LaTeX: classes are now translatable using PO files
 * GUI: Widget based view of the questionnaire
 * LaTex report: Allow the generated LaTeX to be stored

New and updated translations:
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.3

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.2
==================================

Bugfix so that the commands work fine without a TTY.

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.1
==================================

Only depend on distutils and pkg_resources if doing a local run.

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.0
==================================

This is the first release of SDAPS. It is not fully compatible to older
